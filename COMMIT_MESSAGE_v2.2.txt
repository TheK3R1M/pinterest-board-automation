🎯 v2.2: Inventory & Duplicate Detection System

DUPLICATE PREVENTION:
✅ Create board inventory once (pins_inventory.json)
✅ Detect duplicates automatically (duplicates.json)
✅ Smart resume from exact point (no re-saves)
✅ Real-time checkpoint tracking

PROBLEM SOLVED:
Scenario 1: 2000 pins, 500 saved, restart
  Before: User had to re-save all 2000 (500 duplicate)
  After: System detects "resume from #501" ✅

Scenario 2: PC crash during save
  Before: Manual cleanup needed
  After: Auto-detects resume point ✅

Scenario 3: Duplicate detection
  Before: No tracking
  After: Full report in duplicates.json ✅

NEW FEATURES:
- Inventory manager module (pinterest_inventory.py)
- Board scan and inventory creation
- Duplicate detection and reporting
- Smart resume from saved checkpoint
- Success pins "latest" reference file

NEW LOG FILES:
- pins_inventory.json - Complete board scan
- success_pins_latest.json - Latest saves (for comparison)
- duplicates.json - Duplicate report
- progress_checkpoint.json - Resume marker

TECHNICAL:
- New: pinterest_inventory.py (inventory management)
- Updated: main.py (3-step: scan → inventory → resume)
- Updated: logger.py (inventory-compatible logging)

WORKFLOW:
1. python main.py copy
   → Scans 2000 pins → saves with progress

2. If interrupted, just restart:
   → System reads inventory
   → Detects exact resume point
   → No duplicates!

READY FOR:
- Large boards (2000+ pins)
- Interrupted transfers
- PC crashes mid-copy
- Duplicate cleanup (v2.3)

Safe, reliable, duplicate-free copying! 🎉
